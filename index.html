        <h1>clip-path</h1>
        <p>The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region
            that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are
            inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.</p>
        <p>The clip-path property allows you to make complex shapes in CSS by clipping an element to a basic shape
            (circle,
            ellipse, polygon, or inset), or to an SVG source.

            CSS Animations and transitions are possible with two or more clip-path shapes with the same number of
            points.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Clip Path in CSS</h2>
        <p>

            When I first learned CSS clip-path back in the days, I took more time than I had expected, and I struggled
            to
            memorize
            it, too. I don’t know the exact reason, but maybe because I didn’t use it that much? Anyway, I will re-learn
            it
            with
            you.

            In this article, I aim to provide you with a clear explanation of how clip-path works in detail when to use
            it,
            and how
            you can use it today in your web development projects. Are you ready? Let’s dive in.
